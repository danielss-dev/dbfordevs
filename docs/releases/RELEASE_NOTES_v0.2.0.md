# dbfordevs v0.2.0 Release Notes

**Version**: 0.2.0
**Release Date**: December 25, 2025
**Status**: Minor Release (Feature Update)

---

## Overview

v0.2.0 introduces the **AI Query Assistant**, a major milestone in our roadmap. This release transforms dbfordevs from a traditional database client into an intelligent development partner. By integrating industry-leading AI models from Anthropic and Google, developers can now generate, explain, and optimize SQL queries using natural language directly within their workspace.

## Key Features & Enhancements

### 🤖 AI Query Assistant

The new AI Assistant panel provides a dedicated workspace for intelligent database interactions.

#### SQL Generation & Explanation
- **Natural Language to SQL**: Describe what data you want, and the AI generates the appropriate SQL query for your specific database engine.
- **Query Explanation**: Highlight complex SQL to receive a step-by-step breakdown of its logic, performance considerations, and potential pitfalls.
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Get advice on indexing, query restructuring, and database-specific best practices.

#### Intelligent Context Awareness
- **Schema Enrichment**: The AI automatically receives context about your currently selected tables and schema.
- **@ Mentions**: Reference specific tables or columns in your prompt using the `@` symbol for pinpoint accuracy.
- **Database Awareness**: Tailored results for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and more.

#### Multi-Provider Support
- **Anthropic Claude**: Support for the latest Claude 4.5 models (Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku).
- **Google Gemini**: Integration with Gemini 3 Pro and Flash models.
- **Customizable Models**: Switch between providers and specific models based on your needs and API availability.

#### Persistent Chat Management
- **Chat History**: Your conversations are saved locally, allowing you to pick up where you left off.
- **Session Organization**: Create multiple chat sessions, rename them, and mark favorites.
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Optional settings to manage history size and age.

**Benefit**: Dramatically reduce the time spent writing boilerplate SQL and understanding legacy queries.

## Technical Changes

### AI Infrastructure
- **Tauri HTTP Proxy**: All AI API calls are proxied through Tauri's native networking layer, bypassing browser CORS restrictions and improving reliability.
- **Secure Key Storage**: API keys are handled securely and never exposed in client-side logs.
- **Context Enrichment Pipeline**: Optimized system for extracting relevant schema metadata to provide as context to AI models.

### User Interface
- **Collapsible AI Panel**: Access the AI assistant from the new sidebar icon without losing your current editor focus.
- **Provider Switcher**: Quick-access model and provider selection within the chat interface.
- **Code Block Actions**: One-click "Copy to Editor" or "Execute" for SQL generated by the AI.
